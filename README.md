# Portfolio

Hi! This is my portfolio. Made with SvelteKit. Layout inspired in
[Sammwy.com](https://sammwy.com).

All the pixel icons were made from scratch by me and inspired by FontAwesome
icons as well as [NES.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css),
you can find the sources in [icons/](./icons/) (made with Krita).

The used font is [Monocraft](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft),
a beautiful font!
