# Portfolio

Hi! This is my portfolio. Made with SvelteKit, Tailwind, some of BitsUI and MDSveX for rendering markdown content.

Almost all icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons, some are from [devicon](https://devicon.dev/)
and some others were obtained from their respective official sites.

The used font is [Matrix Sans](https://github.com/FriedOrange/MatrixSans),
a beautiful font!

Most image resources were obtained and modified from [resourceboy.com](https://resourceboy.com), check them out.

## Building

After cloning the project, build it with `bun run build`.

```sh
cd portfolio/
bun install
bun run build
```
