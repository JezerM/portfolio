## Introduction

Since my early days of web development, Vue has always been my good to go, not only because of the community but the expressive and simple syntax with Single File Components.

A few years ago I discovered Svelte and how magic it was, which was a big selling point to me, driving me to finally make my portfolio website. That portfolio was designed and made in a week of mid 2023, with far less experience of the framework.

Almost 2 years later, I've been trying to rework it and luckily Svelte 5 was the final push to make it happen. Btw, while Svelte initially attracted me due to its magic, I acknowledge that runes explicitness is far better than implicit reactivity. I loved working with runes in this new website.

## Design

My previous design was inspired in one of [sammwy.com](http://sammwy.com) previous designs, which included a sidebar with some of her details and a top bar for navigation, which looks simple and beatiful. I love 8-bit stuff, pixel-art and terminals, so everything was also inspired on that stuff, making custom hand-made icons with Krita (for everything).

    Yeah, my previous portfolio was basically plagiarism...

Time passes, thoughts change, and what I previously thought was amazing it's no longer. With today's eyes, I still think it's a wonderful design but it always lacked a nice aesthetic that could attract anyone other than me. Therefore, I decided to redesign it all over again.

Now, this website has a paper-like rudimentary aesthetic, with some glassmorphism so it looks cool. "Why?" you may ask, well that's because I like how analogic stuff looks like (yeah, paper is analogic) while I also like modern and simple designs. Thus, I wanted a simple, good looking design that had textures all over the place, mimicking a news paper or a cardboard wall. And yeah, I like coffee.

## Frameworks and tools
